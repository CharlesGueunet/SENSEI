       Catalyst particle rendering example

       This XML configures a ParaView/Catalyst pipeline
       to render points using the point-Gaussian representation.

       This representation accepts a particle-style parameter
       that should be one of:
         + "Gaussian Blur"
         + "Sphere"
         + "Black-edged circle"
         + "Plain circle"
         + "Triangle"
         + "Square Outline"
       You may set the size of the point-Gaussian circles
       using the particle-radius parameter (which defaults to 1.0).

       The camera will default to looking at the origin from the
       point (1,1,1) but will have its position reset along this line
       at each timestep so that the entire dataset is in view.
       You may override these camera settings with the camera-position
       and camera-focus parameters.

       For now, you must include an image-filename parameter
       indicating where to save the image from each timestep.
