       Catalyst particle CDF example

       This XML configures an MPI-based computation to obtain
       inter-quantile boundaries. Specify the number of quantiles
       you want with the `quantiles` attribute.

       The output of the analysis is a Cinema database holding
       the CDF approximation.
       Specify the `working-directory` to indicate the directory
       to hold the database.

       Note that for now, if you want multiple CDF analyses to
       be saved from a single run, you must set the
       `working-directory` attribute to a different directory
       for each one.
